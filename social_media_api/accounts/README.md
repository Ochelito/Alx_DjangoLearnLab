3. User Model Changes

The CustomUser model now includes:

Field	Type	Description
followers	ManyToManyField (self)	Users who follow this user
following	ManyToManyField (self)	Users that this user follows

These fields are asymmetrical: following a user does not automatically make them follow you.

4. Notes

All follow and feed operations require authenticated users.

Feed only displays posts from users the authenticated user is following.

The follow endpoint is idempotent: calling it multiple times toggles the follow status.
